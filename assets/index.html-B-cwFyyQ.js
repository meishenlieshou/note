From the user’s point of view, it acts like a local function call.</p><p>The diagram below illustrates the overall data flow for gRPC.</p><p><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fen0ruob4qssdvxcgsuwc.jpg" alt=""></p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: A REST call is made from the client.

The clients send orders to the order service via the API gateway, which goes to the payment service for payment transactions. The payment service then talks to an external payment service provider (PSP) to complete the transactions.</p><p>There are two ways to handle communications with the external PSP.</p><ul><li><strong>Short polling</strong></li></ul><p>After sending the payment request to the PSP, the payment service keeps asking the PSP about the payment status. After several rounds, the PSP finally returns with the status.</p><p>Short polling has two drawbacks:</p><ul><li><p>Constant polling of the status requires resources from the payment service.</p></li><li><p>The External service communicates directly with the payment service, creating security vulnerabilities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Webhook</strong></p></li></ul><p>We can register a webhook with the external service. It means: call me back at a certain URL when you have updates on the request. When the PSP has completed the processing, it will invoke the HTTP request to update the payment status.</p><p>In this way, the programming paradigm is changed, and the payment service doesn’t need to waste resources to poll the payment status anymore.</p><p>What if the PSP never calls back? We can set up a housekeeping job to check payment status every hour.</p><p>Webhooks are often referred to as reverse APIs or push APIs because the server sends HTTP requests to the client. We need to pay attention to 3 things when using a webhook:</p><ul><li>We need to design a proper API for the external service to call.</li><li>We need to set up proper rules in the API gateway for security reasons.</li><li>We need to register the correct URL at the external service.</li></ul><h2 id="how-to-improve-api-performance" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-improve-api-performance"><span>How to improve API performance?</span></a></h2><p><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F8uxcio3odkweo01j0x9f.jpg" alt=""></p><h3 id="pagination" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pagination"><span>Pagination</span></a></h3><p>This is a common optimization when the size of the result is large. The results are streaming back to the client to improve the service responsiveness.</p><h3 id="asynchronous-logging" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#asynchronous-logging"><span>Asynchronous Logging</span></a></h3><p>Synchronous logging deals with the disk for every call and can slow down the system. Asynchronous logging sends logs to a lock-free buffer first and immediately returns. The logs will be flushed to the disk periodically. This significantly reduces the I/O overhead.</p><h3 id="caching" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#caching"><span>Caching</span></a></h3><p>We can store frequently accessed data into a cache. The client can query the cache first instead of visiting the database directly. If there is a cache miss, the client can query from the database. Caches like Redis store data in memory, so the data access is much faster than the database.</p><h3 id="payload-compression" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#payload-compression"><span>Payload Compression</span></a></h3><p>The requests and responses can be compressed using gzip etc so that the transmitted data size is much smaller. This speeds up the upload and download.</p><h3 id="connection-pool" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#connection-pool"><span>Connection Pool</span></a></h3><p>When accessing resources, we often need to load data from the database. Opening the closing db connections adds significant overhead. So we should connect to the db via a pool of open connections. The connection pool is responsible for managing the connection lifecycle.</p><h2 id="http-protocol" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#http-protocol"><span>HTTP Protocol</span></a></h2><p>What problem does each generation of HTTP solve? The diagram below illustrates the key features.</p><p><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Febkmm1s7kxwcye8iaofo.jpg" alt=""></p><h3 id="http-1-0" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#http-1-0"><span>HTTP 1.0</span></a></h3><p>HTTP 1.0 was finalized and fully documented in 1996. Every request to the same server requires a separate TCP connection.</p><h3 id="http-1-1" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#http-1-1"><span>HTTP 1.1</span></a></h3><p>HTTP 1.1 was published in 1997. A TCP connection can be left open for reuse (persistent connection), but it doesn’t solve the HOL (head-of-line) blocking issue. HOL blocking - when the number of allowed parallel requests in the browser is used up, subsequent requests need to wait for the former ones to complete.</p><h3 id="http-2-0" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#http-2-0"><span>HTTP 2.0</span></a></h3><p>HTTP 2.0 was published in 2015. It addresses HOL issue through request multiplexing, which eliminates HOL blocking at the application layer, but HOL still exists at the transport (TCP) layer.</p><p>As you can see in the diagram, HTTP 2.0 introduced the concept of HTTP “streams”: an abstraction that allows multiplexing different HTTP exchanges onto the same TCP connection. Each stream doesn’t need to be sent in order.</p><h3 id="http-3-0" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#http-3-0"><span>HTTP 3.0</span></a></h3><p>HTTP 3.0 first draft was published in 2020. It is the proposed successor to HTTP 2.0. It uses QUIC instead of TCP for the underlying transport protocol, thus removing HOL blocking in the transport layer.</p><p>QUIC is based on UDP. It introduces streams as first-class citizens at the transport layer. QUIC streams share the same QUIC connection, so no additional handshakes and slow starts are required to create new ones, but QUIC streams are delivered independently such that in most cases packet loss affecting one stream doesn&#39;t affect others.</p><h2 id="soap-vs-rest-vs-graphql-vs-rpc" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#soap-vs-rest-vs-graphql-vs-rpc"><span>SOAP vs REST vs GraphQL vs RPC</span></a></h2><p>The diagram below illustrates the API timeline and API styles comparison. Over time, different API architectural styles are released. Each of them has its own patterns of standardizing data exchange.

Why do we want to consider API first design?</p><p><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2F6i8yhphom9ozbampyswy.jpg" alt=""></p><ul><li>Microservices increase system complexity and we have separate services to serve different functions of the system. While this kind of architecture facilitates decoupling and segregation of duty, we need to handle the various communications among services. It is better to think through the system&#39;s complexity before writing the code and carefully defining the boundaries of the services.</li><li>Separate functional teams need to speak the same language and the dedicated functional teams are only responsible for their own components and services. It is recommended that the organization speak the same language via API design. We can mock requests and responses to validate the API design before writing code.</li><li>Improve software quality and developer productivity Since we have ironed out most of the uncertainties when the project starts, the overall development process is smoother, and the software quality is greatly improved.</li></ul><p>Developers are happy about the process as well because they can focus on functional development instead of negotiating sudden changes. The possibility of having surprises toward the end of the project lifecycle is reduced. Because we have designed the API first, the tests can be designed while the code is being developed. In a way, we also have TDD (Test Driven Design) when using API first development.</p><h2 id="http-status-codes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#http-status-codes"><span>HTTP status codes</span></a></h2><p><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fy4nk3t8k8vqcpddfeb9l.jpg" alt=""></p><h2 id="what-does-api-gateway-do" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-does-api-gateway-do"><span>What does API gateway do?</span></a></h2><p>The diagram below shows the details.</p><p><img src="https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fw48hafx6xy3qwwu3azzn.jpg" alt=""></p><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: The client sends an HTTP request to the API gateway.</li><li><strong>Step 2</strong>: The API gateway parses and validates the attributes in the HTTP request.</li><li><strong>Step 3</strong>: The API gateway performs allow-list/deny-list checks.</li><li><strong>Step 4</strong>: The API gateway talks to an identity provider for authentication and authorization.</li><li><strong>Step 5</strong>: The rate limiting rules are applied to the request.
