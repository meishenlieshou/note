Indexed content is then eligible to appear in search results.</li><li><strong>Ranking</strong>: When a user enters a query, search engines use their algorithms to rank the most relevant and authoritative content. Websites that align with SEO best practices are more likely to rank higher.</li><li><strong>Displaying Results</strong>: Search engines display the ranked results on SERPs, often accompanied by additional features like featured snippets, images, or local maps.</li></ul><h2 id="types-of-seo" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#types-of-seo"><span>Types of SEO</span></a></h2><p>SEO can be broadly categorized into three main types: On-Page SEO, Off-Page SEO, and Technical SEO.
