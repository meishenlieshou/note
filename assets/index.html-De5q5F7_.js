Instead, Yarn uses a virtual file system to resolve dependencies, which improved install times and reduced disk usage.</li><li><strong>Zero-Install</strong>: With Plug’n’Play, Yarn 2 made it possible to avoid having to run yarn install entirely in certain cases. This is useful for reducing CI/CD pipeline times.</li><li><strong>Better Monorepo Support</strong>: Yarn 2 expanded on workspaces, improving monorepo management.</li><li><strong>Easier plugin system</strong>: The new version of Yarn introduced a flexible plugin system, allowing the community and developers to add custom functionality easily.</li></ol><h3 id="future-of-yarn" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#future-of-yarn"><span>Future of Yarn</span></a></h3><p>Yarn&#39;s development continues to evolve, with newer versions (like Yarn 3) continuing to improve performance, maintain compatibility with npm’s ecosystem, and expand functionality.
